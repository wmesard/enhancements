## Summary

Build support for the out-of-tree OpenStack cloud provider. This involves a well-tested version of the cloud-controller-manager 
that has feature parity to the kube-controller-manager. 

## Motivation

Motivation for supporting out-of-tree providers can be found in the [Cloud Controller Manager KEP](/keps/sig-cloud-provider/2392-cloud-controller-manager/README.md).
This KEP is specifically tracking progress for the OpenStack cloud provider.

### Goals

* Develop/test/release the OpenStack cloud-controller-manager
* Kubernetes clusters running on OpenStack should be running the cloud-controller-manager.

### Non-Goals

* Removing in-tree OpenStack cloud provider code, this effort falls under the [KEP for removing in-tree providers](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/blob/master/keps/sig-cloud-provider/20190125-removing-in-tree-providers.md).

## Proposal
The OpenStack Cloud Provider is implemented, tested and documented, It is being released with matching kubernetes version from [release v1.11](https://github.com/kubernetes/cloud-provider-openstack/releases). cloud-provider-openstack release 1.14, 1.15, 1.16 has been running in production.

### Implementation Details/Notes/Constraints [optional]
OpenStack Cloud Provider is implemented [here](https://github.com/kubernetes/cloud-provider-openstack/releases). This repository also hosts other drivers like CSI, ingress-controller etc. Cloud Provider OpenStack is in feature parity with the intree version. Removal of intree cloud providers is dependent on [In-tree Storage Migration to CSI Plugin Migration](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/design-proposals/storage/csi-migration.md). The migration work for intree OpenStack Volume driver to CSI Driver is in progress.

### Risks and Mitigations

None as of now
## Design Details

### Test Plan
OpenStack Cloud Provider is well tested, CI running at [OpenLab](https://github.com/theopenlab/openlab-zuul-jobs), results are reported to kubernetes test grid.

### Graduation Criteria

This feature is complete, well tested, in parity with intree openstack provider. Documention regarding migration from in-tree cloud provider to openstack-cloud-controller-manager can be found [here](https://github.com/kubernetes/cloud-provider-openstack/blob/master/docs/migrate-to-ccm-with-csimigration.md)

### Upgrade / Downgrade Strategy

TODO for SIG-OpenStack
 
### Version Skew Strategy

TODO for SIG-OpenStack

## Implementation History
- Implementation and testing completed in 2018.
- Matching kubernetes versions released from v1.11, latest version is v1.17.
