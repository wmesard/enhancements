## Summary

Build support for the out-of-tree GCE cloud provider. This involves a well-tested version of the cloud-controller-manager 
that has feature parity to the kube-controller-manager. 

## Motivation

Motivation for supporting out-of-tree providers can be found in the [Cloud Controller Manager KEP](/keps/sig-cloud-provider/2392-cloud-controller-manager/README.md).
This KEP is specifically tracking progress for the GCE cloud provider.

### Goals

* Develop/test/release the GCE cloud-controller-manager
* Kubernetes clusters running on GCE should be running the cloud-controller-manager.

### Non-Goals

* Removing in-tree GCE cloud provider code, this effort falls under the [KEP for removing in-tree providers](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/blob/master/keps/sig-cloud-provider/20190125-removing-in-tree-providers.md).
